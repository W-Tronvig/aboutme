<p>Hi there! Thanks for visiting my very first web page! I'm a new Full-Stack Software Developer student at Alchemy Code Lab here in Portland, Oregon. I'm also an entrepreneur, inventor, and a HUGE dog lover - if you couldn't tell ;-).</p>
<br>
<p>My main goal for this site is to have it become a platform for my future website which will be based around James (my dog) who passed away last May.</p> 
<br>
</p>The focus will be to bring people together with a common product  and spread the awareness of       animal rights and adoption. The goal will be to ultimately create another branch of support for         shelters across the country. I hope you enjoy what I've put in here for you! Feel free to connect       with my via my LinkedIn handle below!</p>
