          <p>Test Hi there! Thanks for visiting my very first web page! I'm a new Full-Stack Software Developer student at Alchemy Code Lab here in Portland, Oregon. I'm also an entrepreneur, inventor, and a HUGE dog lover - if you couldn't tell ;-).</p>
          <br>
          <p>My main goal for this site is to have it become a platform for my future website which will be based around James (my dog) who passed away last May.</p>
        <br>
         <p> In his memory, the site's focus will be to bring people together with a common product  and spread the awareness of animal rights and adoption. The goal will be to ultimately create another branch of support for shelters across the country.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I hope you enjoy what I've put together here for you! Feel free to connect with me via my LinkedIn handle below! Also check out my YouTube channel for some past videos of James! Cheers!</p>

          <h3>Aside from being an animal lover, I also enjoy:</h3>
              <ol>
              <li>Multi-day backpacking trips</li>
              <li>Golfing</li>
              <li>Snowboarding</li>
              <li>Lifting</li>
              <li>Running</li>

             </ol>
             <p>Being outdoors has always been a big passion of mine. There's something about being on your own in the wilderness that brings you closer to yourself and the world around you. In taking the time to immerse yourself within nature, especially in the beautiful Pacific Northwest, I feel that we can truly self reflect and find who we are meant to be.</p>
             <br>
             <p>Speaking of outdoors, let's talk about snowboarding and golf! I used to play on the golf team in high school and have been snowboarding since I was tweleve! I love both the sports, though radically different, they each provide a great outlet and source of fun! If I can't get outside away from the city, then I also love going to the gym and for short runs, weather permitting for the runs of course ;)</p>
           <br>
            <p>When I'm not outside, you can usually find me in comfy chair reading or in the garage painting or sculpting. Some of my favorites mediums include, acrylics, oils, charcoal, clay, metals, and carpentry.</p>

    <div class="career">
          <h1 id="career">Career and Education</h1>
          <p>My previous career was a position as a Junior Patent Paralegal in Seattle, WA for two international law firms. It was a great career and the experience I gained was truly invaluable along with the people I met and connections I made. I've wanted to get into programming for several years now, which is why I left and I am now able to pursue this long awaited goal of mine!</p>
          <br>
          <p>For my education, I went to Washington State University and graduated with a degree in Philosophy/Pre-Law.</p>
