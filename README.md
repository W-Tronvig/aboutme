# ABOUT ME

## OVERVIEW

This is a web application that gathers user data through Javascript and allows for the user to interact with the website. The main purpose here is obviously icecream. Since we are trying to decide which icecream is the best flavor.

## INSTALLATION

## FEATURES
The website background is a very nice linear.gradient that is easy on the eyes :-)
## KNOWN BUGS
Originally there was a bug with this program, since the prompt would ask you for the answer, and if you answered yes, the prompt would provide you with the yes alert and then immediately provide you with the no alert. This problem was alleviated by bracketing the correct code block to run after the initial if statement.
